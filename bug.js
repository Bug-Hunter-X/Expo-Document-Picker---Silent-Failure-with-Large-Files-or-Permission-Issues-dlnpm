This error occurs when using the Expo Document Picker API and selecting a file larger than what is supported by the native file picker, or when there are issues with file permissions or access.  The specific error message might vary depending on the platform (iOS or Android) and the file system limitations.  The code might appear to work correctly, selecting a file, but the file data will be empty or corrupted.  This often surfaces silently, requiring careful debugging.
